# Linear Regression Example
The purpose of the R script is to demonstrate linear regression 
statistical analyses. This was made mostly for my own reference and as a way 
to practice, so it is far from perfect or comprehensive, but I will share it 
here for others who may find it helpful.

Linear regression is a linear model, 
e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables 
(x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be 
calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).

This script also includes an example of a linear mixed effects model.
Linear mixed models are an extension of simple linear models to allow both 
fixed and random effects, and are particularly used when there is non 
independence in the data, such as arises from a hierarchical structure.
